			Hi Peter,
			<br>
			Thanks for the e-mail. It is always nice to hear from people, especially from you, Scott.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have not got any reply, a positive or negative one, from Seibido yet.
			<br>
			Let's wait and hope that it will make a BOOK.
		</p>
		<p>
			Have you finished your paperwork for Kaken and writing academic articles?
			<br>
			If you have some free time in the near future, I want to meet you and explain to you our next project.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sincerely, K. Nakagawa
